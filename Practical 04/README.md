1. Write a Kotlin program that creates an immutable list of colors ("red", "blue", "green")
using listOf() and prints each color on a new line.
2. Create a Kotlin program that creates an empty mutable list to store the names of your
friends. Prompt the user to enter three names, add them to the list, and then print the list.
3. Write a Kotlin program that asks the user to enter five numbers and stores them in an
array. Calculate and display the sum of those numbers.
4. Write a Kotlin program that creates an array with mixed types to store the details of three
students: name (String), age (Int), and grade (Char). Prompt the user to enter the details
for each student and then print the array.
5. Create a Kotlin program that creates two arrays: array1 with elements [5, 2, 9] and
array2 with elements [3, 7, 1]. Combine these arrays and print the resulting array in
descending order.
6. Write a Kotlin program to find the largest and smallest numbers in an array. Create an
array using arrayOf() to store a series of numbers. Find the maximum and minimum
values in the array and print them.
7. Write a Kotlin program that simulates a grocery shopping list. Create an array using
arrayOf() to store the items to be purchased, including their names, quantities, and
prices. Print the details of each item and calculate the total cost.
8. Write a Kotlin program that combines two arrays of different types. Create an array of
names using arrayOf() and an array of ages using arrayOf(). Combine the two arrays to
create a new array of pairs representing name-age pairs.
9. Create a Kotlin program that combines two arrays into a single array. Create two arrays
using arrayOf() to store the names of fruits and the names of vegetables. Combine the
two arrays into a single array containing all the names.
10. Write a Kotlin program that simulates a to-do list. Create an array using arrayOf() to
store the tasks to be done. Print each task on a new line and indicate whether it has
been completed or not.
