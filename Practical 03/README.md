01. Write a Kotlin program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a
function. The function should take an integer as a parameter and return its factorial.
Display the calculated factorial on the screen.

Example Output:
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120

3. Write a Kotlin program that checks if a given number is prime using a function. The
function should take an integer as a parameter and return true if the number is prime
and false otherwise. Display the result on the screen.

Example output:
Enter a number: 17
17 is a prime number.

5. Write a Kotlin program that determines a person's age group based on the value of
the variable 'age.' The age is already assigned a value of 25. If the age is less than
18, print 'You are a minor.' If the age is between 18 and 64 (inclusive), print 'You are
an adult.' Otherwise, if the age is greater than or equal to 65, print 'You are a senior
citizen.'
6. Write a Kotlin program that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop.
7. Write a Kotlin program that calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and a
given number (inclusive) using a while loop. Display the sum on the screen.

Example output:
Enter a number: 10
The sum of even numbers between 1 and 10 is: 30
